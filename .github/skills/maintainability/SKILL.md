Use this skill for any code or content change in this repo, including refactors, content updates, and SEO tweaks.

Guidelines:
- Keep the file structure clean and intuitive.
- Favor clarity over cleverness in code and content.
- Design for long-term content growth and easy maintenance.
- Avoid unnecessary abstractions or dependencies.
- After changes, always run `npm run build`, review the output, and fix any build errors before reporting completion.
