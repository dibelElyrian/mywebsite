description: Design scalable static blog structures with Markdown content, including category, tag, and slug routing.
---

Use this skill when building or refactoring the static blog architecture.

Guidelines:
- Keep content in Markdown under a clear content directory structure.
- Define stable slugs and route patterns for posts, categories, and tags.
- Prefer deterministic routing based on frontmatter and file paths.
- Keep the build static and predictable for Netlify deployments.
