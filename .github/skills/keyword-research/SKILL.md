description: Research trending Filipino search queries and identify high-value topics that answer real questions.
---

Use this skill when planning new blog content to ensure topics target real user questions with meaningful search volume.

Purpose:
- Identify what Filipinos are actually searching for
- Prioritize topics that answer genuine questions
- Find content gaps not yet covered by existing posts
- Balance search demand with competition

Research sources (in priority order):
1. Google Trends Philippines (trends.google.com.ph)
   - Check rising queries in relevant categories
   - Compare seasonal patterns
   - Identify breakout topics
2. Google Autocomplete (search.google.com.ph)
   - Type partial queries and note suggestions
   - Add "sa pilipinas", "ph", "affordable" modifiers
3. AnswerThePublic or similar tools
   - Find question-based queries (how, what, why, where)
4. Reddit Philippines, Facebook groups
   - Observe recurring questions and pain points
5. Shopee/Lazada trending searches (for product-related topics only)

Topic selection criteria:
1. Relevance: Does it match the site niche (practical living, budget-smart)?
2. Search intent: What does the searcher want to accomplish?
3. Answerability: Can we provide genuine, helpful content?
4. Competition: Is there room for a quality answer?
5. Evergreen potential: Will this topic remain relevant?

Search volume tiers:
- High: Popular queries with strong search demand (pillar content opportunity)
- Medium: Moderate search volume (cluster content opportunity)
- Low: Niche queries with specific intent (quick answer opportunity)
- Emerging: Rising trends with growth potential

Content type mapping:
- "How to..." queries → Step-by-step guides
- "Best..." queries → Comparison or listicle (may include products)
- "What is..." queries → Explainer content
- "Where to..." queries → Location or resource guides
- "Why..." queries → Educational content
- Problem statements → Solution-focused guides

Quality-first filtering rules:
1. PASS a topic if:
   - It answers a real question Filipinos are searching for
   - We can provide genuine, helpful content
   - It fits the site niche (practical living, budget tips)
2. SKIP a topic if:
   - The only value is affiliate links (no genuine help)
   - We cannot provide unique insight or value
   - It requires expertise we cannot credibly offer
3. Product topics are ALLOWED when:
   - The searcher genuinely needs product guidance
   - We can provide honest, research-backed recommendations
   - The affiliate opportunity is secondary to reader value

Keyword research output format:
For each proposed topic, provide:
- Target keyword: The primary search query to target
- Search intent: What the searcher wants to accomplish
- Content angle: How we will answer the question
- Content tier: Pillar (2,000+ words), Cluster (900-1,500 words), or Quick (500-900 words)
- Volume tier: High, Medium, Low, or Emerging
- Competition notes: Brief observation on existing content quality
- Monetization fit: Natural affiliate opportunity, AdSense only, or none

Pre-generation requirement:
- Before writing any new post, keyword research is MANDATORY
- Present the keyword research output to confirm topic viability
- If multiple topics are proposed, rank by value (reader value first, then monetization potential)

Topic validation checklist:
1. Does this topic answer a real question? (required)
2. Can we provide genuine value? (required)
3. Is this topic already covered in topic-registry.md? (check for overlap)
4. What content tier is appropriate?
5. Is there a natural affiliate opportunity? (optional, not required)

Failure handling:
- If no quality topics are found, do not force content generation
- Instead, suggest broader research or a different angle
- Quality over quantity: one excellent post beats three mediocre ones
