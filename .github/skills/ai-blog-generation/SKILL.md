Use this skill when generating new blog posts or refreshing existing content.

Guidelines:
- Perform deep research on current product trends using reputable sources (official brand pages, marketplaces, tech/consumer publications, and local PH context when possible).
- Clearly separate verified facts from assumptions; avoid unverified claims.
- Do not claim personal testing, hands-on reviews, or guaranteed outcomes.
- Write clean, publication-ready copy that needs minimal proofreading.
- Emphasize value for budget-conscious Filipino buyers: availability and key use cases.
- Use a helpful, neutral tone that supports informed decisions.
- Include affiliate disclosures when linking to Shopee or TikTok Shop.
- Avoid deceptive or policy-violating content; do not promise earnings or savings.
- Provide structured output with: title, description, slug, date, category, tags, and a clear outline.
- Add internal links to related posts when available.

Quality checks:
- Clear introduction, scannable headings, and concise summaries.
- Accurate dates and availability notes with a “may change” disclaimer.
- Respect SEO best practices: unique title, compelling meta description, and natural keyword usage.
