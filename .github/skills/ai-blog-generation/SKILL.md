description: Create high-quality, conversion-focused blog posts for SulitFinds using research-backed product trends and compliant affiliate messaging.
---

Use this skill when generating new blog posts or refreshing existing content.

Guidelines:
- Perform deep research on current product trends using reputable sources (official brand pages, marketplaces, tech/consumer publications, and local PH context when possible).
- Clearly separate verified facts from assumptions; avoid unverified claims.
- Do not claim personal testing, hands-on reviews, or guaranteed outcomes.
- Write clean, publication-ready copy that needs minimal proofreading.
- Do not use em dashes or en dashes. Use hyphen-minus or commas and periods instead.
- Copyright and asset usage:
	- Do not use copyrighted images, text, or media without explicit permission.
	- Do not copy content from brand sites, marketplaces, blogs, or reviews.
	- All written content must be original and paraphrased properly.
- Image usage rules:
	- Only use images that are public domain, CC0, royalty-free, or explicitly licensed for commercial use.
	- Acceptable sources include public-domain or CC0 libraries, AI-generated images created specifically for this site, and simple original graphics such as icons or diagrams.
	- Do not hotlink images from Shopee, TikTok Shop, brand websites, or other blogs or review sites.
- Image handling requirements:
	- Prefer generic, non-branded visuals such as product category illustrations or lifestyle shots.
	- Avoid logos, trademarks, or identifiable brand packaging unless clearly allowed.
	- Add descriptive alt text that does not imply ownership or endorsement.
- Content generation rules:
	- Do not reproduce copyrighted product descriptions verbatim.
	- Summaries must be original and written in the site voice.
	- Avoid close paraphrasing that mirrors original sentence structure.
- Content length rules (mandatory):
	- Every blog post must be long-form.
	- Minimum length: 900 words.
	- Target length: 1,000-1,200 words.
	- Absolute maximum: 1,500 words unless explicitly requested.
	- Do not generate short-form posts for publishing.
	- If a generated draft is below 900 words:
		- Expand it with additional useful sections such as guides, comparisons, FAQs, or clarifications.
		- Do not pad with fluff or repetitive phrasing.
	- Word count must be checked before final output.
	- Include the final word count at the end of the draft for verification as an internal note only, not for publishing.
- Monetization eligibility check (mandatory):
	- Before generating a blog post, determine whether the topic can naturally include Shopee or TikTok Shop affiliate links.
	- If a topic cannot reasonably support product-based affiliate links, do not generate the post.
	- Instead, suggest an alternative topic that fits SulitFinds product affiliate model.
- Shopee or TikTok compatibility requirement:
	- All generated blog posts must allow at least 1 product recommendation and at least 1 affiliate placeholder link.
	- Content should center on physical consumer products, home, lifestyle, tech, or everyday items commonly sold on Shopee or TikTok Shop.
- Affiliate placeholder enforcement:
	- For every recommended product, insert a unique placeholder link using this format: [Check on Shopee](SHOPEE_LINK_PLACEHOLDER_<PRODUCT_KEY>).
	- Product keys must be clear and unique.
	- Do not include real URLs.
	- Do not include placeholders for mere mentions.
- Linking constraints:
	- Max 3-6 affiliate placeholders per 1,000 words.
	- Link each product only once per article.
	- Prefer placing placeholders inside dedicated recommendation sections or product CTA blocks.
	- Avoid inserting placeholders mid sentence unless it adds clear decision value.
- Output requirements:
	- At the end of each draft, include a Link Map section listing product name, placeholder ID, and the section where it appears.
- Safety and integrity:
	- Do not generate content that cannot be monetized ethically via product affiliates.
	- Do not force products into unrelated topics.
- Emphasize value for budget-conscious Filipino buyers: availability and key use cases.
- Use a helpful, neutral tone that supports informed decisions.
- Include affiliate disclosures when linking to Shopee or TikTok Shop.
- Distinguish between mentions vs recommendations:
	- Mentions: informational references → no affiliate link.
	- Recommendations: actionable suggestions → eligible for affiliate links.
- Affiliate linking rules:
	- Do NOT hyperlink every item mentioned.
	- Do ensure that every recommended item can be linked to Shopee or TikTok Shop.
	- Limit inline affiliate links to max 3-6 per 1,000 words.
	- Link each product only once per article.
	- Use rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer" and target="_blank" for affiliate links.
- Avoid deceptive or policy-violating content; do not promise earnings or savings.
- Content integrity:
	- Avoid turning lists into link farms.
	- Prefer one clear CTA block per recommendation section.
	- Inline links only where they add decision value.
	- Never use urgency, fake scarcity, or deceptive language.
- Authoring convenience:
	- When recommending an item, use clear, specific product names to make link insertion easy.
- Provide structured output with: title, description, slug, date, category, tags, and a clear outline.
- Add internal links to related posts when available.
- Before finalizing, confirm that all images and content used comply with the copyright and asset usage policy.

Scope:
- Applies to new and refreshed or rewritten blog posts.
- Does not apply to About page, Disclaimer page, or UI copy.

Quality checks:
- Clear introduction, scannable headings, and concise summaries.
- Accurate dates and availability notes with a “may change” disclaimer.
- Respect SEO best practices: unique title, compelling meta description, and natural keyword usage.
