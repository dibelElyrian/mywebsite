description: Reduce AI-writing fingerprints and normalize content to sound human.
---

Use this skill for any content creation or edits across SulitFinds.

Rules:
- Avoid common AI markers, including:
  - Em dashes and en dashes.
  - Overly formal transitions like "Moreover", "Furthermore", and "In conclusion".
  - Symmetrical sentence structures repeated across paragraphs.
  - Overuse of generic qualifiers such as "very", "highly", and "extremely".
- Prefer:
  - Commas or periods instead of dashes.
  - Natural phrasing commonly used by human writers.
  - Slight sentence variation and rhythm.
- When editing existing content:
  - Normalize phrasing without changing intent.
  - Preserve factual accuracy.
  - Do not add hype or urgency.

Operational requirement:
- Before finalizing any content or code change that includes text, run this AI-content normalization pass.
