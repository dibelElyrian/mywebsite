description: Reduce AI-writing fingerprints and normalize content to sound human.

Use this skill for any content creation or edits across SulitFinds.

Why this matters:
- AI-generated content can be flagged by Google and hurt SEO rankings
- Readers trust human-sounding content more
- Authenticity builds long-term audience trust

Common AI writing patterns to AVOID:

1. Punctuation markers:
   - Em dashes and en dashes (use commas, periods, or hyphens instead)
   - Excessive semicolons in casual content
   - Overuse of colons for lists

2. Sentence starters to AVOID:
   - "In today's world..." or "In today's fast-paced..."
   - "When it comes to..."
   - "It's important to note that..."
   - "It's worth mentioning that..."
   - "Let's dive in" or "Let's explore"
   - "Whether you're a... or a..."
   - "From X to Y, there's something for everyone"

3. Transition words to AVOID or limit:
   - "Moreover", "Furthermore", "Additionally" (overused by AI)
   - "In conclusion", "To summarize", "In summary"
   - "That being said", "With that in mind"
   - "It goes without saying"
   - "Needless to say"

4. Filler phrases to REMOVE:
   - "It's no secret that..."
   - "The truth is..."
   - "At the end of the day..."
   - "All in all..."
   - "Last but not least..."
   - "Without further ado..."

5. Generic qualifiers to LIMIT:
   - "Very", "highly", "extremely", "incredibly"
   - "Absolutely", "definitely", "certainly"
   - "Robust", "seamless", "cutting-edge", "state-of-the-art"

6. Structural patterns to BREAK:
   - Perfectly symmetrical paragraphs (same length, same structure)
   - Every paragraph starting with a transition word
   - Lists where every item has the exact same format
   - Overly consistent sentence length throughout

7. Tone markers to AVOID:
   - Excessive enthusiasm ("Amazing!", "Incredible!", "Game-changer!")
   - Corporate buzzwords ("leverage", "synergy", "optimize")
   - Fake conversational hooks ("You might be wondering...")

What to DO instead:

1. Vary sentence length naturally:
   - Mix short punchy sentences with longer explanatory ones
   - Let some paragraphs be 2 sentences, others 4-5

2. Use natural Filipino-English code-switching when appropriate:
   - "Sulit na sulit ang bili mo" (when it fits the tone)
   - Common Filipino expressions readers would use

3. Be specific instead of generic:
   - Instead of "affordable price" → "under PHP 500"
   - Instead of "many options" → "around 5-6 choices"

4. Write like you're explaining to a friend:
   - Direct address ("you") is fine
   - Skip formal introductions when the title already explains the topic
   - Get to the point faster

5. Allow imperfection:
   - Not every section needs a perfect transition
   - Some paragraphs can just start with the main point
   - Vary your list formats (some bulleted, some numbered, some inline)

6. Use active voice predominantly:
   - "This kettle heats water in 3 minutes" not "Water is heated in 3 minutes by this kettle"

7. Include specific details that AI typically lacks:
   - Local context (Philippine weather, typical Filipino households)
   - Practical observations (not claims of personal testing)
   - Real constraints (Manila apartment sizes, typical budgets)

Pre-publish checklist:
1. Read the content aloud - does it sound natural?
2. Check for repeated phrase patterns across paragraphs
3. Verify no em dashes or en dashes remain
4. Ensure transitions vary and don't all follow the same pattern
5. Confirm specific details replace generic claims
6. Check that enthusiasm levels are realistic, not excessive

Operational requirement:
- Before finalizing any blog post, run this AI-content normalization pass
- Flag any content that still reads robotic after normalization
- When in doubt, simplify and shorten rather than elaborate
