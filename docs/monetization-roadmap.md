# Monetization Roadmap

This roadmap outlines monetization options for SulitFinds, ordered by difficulty for a solo developer running a static Netlify site.

**Core principle:** Traffic through valuable content first, monetization second. All revenue strategies should support, not undermine, the reader-first approach.

## Primary: Google AdSense
**Difficulty:** Easy

**Setup effort:** Add AdSense verification code, create ads.txt, ensure content quality and legal pages exist.

**When to start:** Immediately after 25+ quality posts (current status).

**Why it fits quality-first:**
- Revenue scales with traffic, not product pushing
- Works on all content types (how-tos, guides, tips)
- No pressure to force product links

**Current status:** Verification deployed, awaiting approval.

## Secondary: Affiliate links (Shopee/TikTok)
**Difficulty:** Easy

**Setup effort:** Include at least 1 affiliate link per post, but only when products genuinely help the reader; batch CSV is source of truth. If no relevant product exists, request an exception.

**When to start:** Start now - plan each post to include a small, genuinely helpful recommendation section.

**Risks/pitfalls:**
- Over-linking can hurt trust and reduce readability.
- Non-compliant disclosures can cause policy or network issues.
- Forcing products into unrelated content damages credibility.

**Best-fit content types:**
- Buying guides where products genuinely help
- Comparison posts where readers need to make a purchase decision
- How-to guides only when a genuinely helpful product can be recommended, otherwise request an exception

## 3) Sponsored content
**Difficulty:** Medium

**Setup effort:** Create a sponsored content policy, disclosure template, and a contact page; define pricing and review workflow.

**When to start:** After consistent publishing cadence and baseline traffic (e.g., 15-25 posts).

**Risks/pitfalls:**
- Brand-fit mismatches can erode credibility.
- Disclosure gaps can violate platform policies.

**Best-fit content types:**
- Brand-aligned reviews or spotlights.
- Category-specific buying guides.

## 3) Digital products (PDFs, checklists, curated lists)
**Difficulty:** Medium

**Setup effort:** Build simple downloadable assets and a landing page; use a lightweight checkout or external payment link.

**When to start:** After you identify repeat-reader pain points and have 20+ posts.

**Risks/pitfalls:**
- Low perceived value if assets are too thin.
- Requires updates as prices and listings change.

**Best-fit content types:**
- Printable checklists and buying planners.
- Curated lists for common budgets and use cases.

## 4) Email list + newsletter monetization
**Difficulty:** Medium

**Setup effort:** Add opt-in forms, lead magnets, and a basic newsletter cadence; integrate a provider that supports affiliate links.

**When to start:** After you can commit to a consistent email schedule (monthly or biweekly).

**Risks/pitfalls:**
- Inconsistent sending reduces trust.
- Poor segmentation leads to low engagement.

**Best-fit content types:**
- Weekly deals or “best picks” recaps.
- Seasonal buying guides and promos.

## 5) Ads (AdSense)
**Difficulty:** Medium

**Setup effort:** Apply, add ad slots, and tune placements to avoid harming readability; monitor Core Web Vitals.

**When to start:** After steady traffic (e.g., 20-40 posts and organic visits).

**Risks/pitfalls:**
- Too many ads can hurt UX and rankings.
- Approval can be slow or denied without content depth.

**Best-fit content types:**
- High-traffic evergreen guides.
- Longer posts where ad slots are less disruptive.

## 6) Lead generation
**Difficulty:** Hard

**Setup effort:** Define lead capture forms, qualification rules, and partner handoff; ensure privacy compliance and data handling.

**When to start:** After stable traffic and clear partner demand.

**Risks/pitfalls:**
- Compliance and privacy risks if data is mishandled.
- Poor lead quality can damage partnerships.

**Best-fit content types:**
- Service comparison guides.
- “Best for…” decision trees.

## 7) Direct partnerships with sellers/brands
**Difficulty:** Hard

**Setup effort:** Build a media kit, define sponsorship packages, and conduct outreach; track outcomes and reporting.

**When to start:** After measurable audience size and engagement metrics.

**Risks/pitfalls:**
- Time-intensive outreach with low response rates.
- Overpromising results can harm long-term trust.

**Best-fit content types:**
- Seasonal campaigns and promos.
- Dedicated brand feature pages.

## 8) Comparison tables/tools (calculators, quizzes, product tables)
**Difficulty:** Hard

**Setup effort:** Design UI components, maintain data accuracy, and ensure performance; build lightweight tools that work offline.

**When to start:** After clear user demand and enough traffic to justify maintenance.

**Risks/pitfalls:**
- Data staleness reduces credibility.
- Over-engineering can slow the site.

**Best-fit content types:**
- Price/feature comparisons.
- “Pick the best option” quizzes.
