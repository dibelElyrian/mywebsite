## Outline

- Check cookware compatibility first
- Understand wattage and power needs
- Keep safety and ventilation in mind
- Compare three budget induction cookers

## Cookware compatibility basics

Induction cookers only work with magnetic cookware. The easiest test is a magnet.

- If a magnet sticks to the bottom of the pot, it will work
- Stainless steel and cast iron usually work
- Aluminum and glass usually do not, unless they have a magnetic base

Before buying, check the diameter range. Some induction cookers require a minimum pot size to activate.

## Power and wattage

Most budget models in the Philippines range from 1800W to 2000W. Higher wattage heats faster but draws more power.

- For small apartments, 1800W to 2000W is common and enough for daily meals
- Use a stable outlet and avoid overloading extension cords
- If your breaker trips often, use the cooker on a separate outlet

## Controls and cooking modes

Many models include preset modes, but basic temperature and power control matters more. Look for clear buttons and a readable display so you can adjust quickly.

For daily cooking, you only need:

- Low for simmering and reheating
- Medium for frying and sauté
- High for boiling or quick sear

## Energy use and meal planning

Induction cookers are efficient, but energy use still matters in small apartments. You can save power by covering pots with lids and using the right pot size. A wide pot on low heat often cooks faster than a small pot on high heat.

## Safety and ventilation tips

Induction cookers produce less ambient heat, but good airflow still helps.

- Keep the back vent clear
- Place the cooker on a flat, stable surface
- Do not block the underside intake

If you cook in a small room, keep a small window open to reduce heat buildup.
