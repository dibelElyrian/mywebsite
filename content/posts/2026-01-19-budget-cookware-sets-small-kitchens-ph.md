## Outline

- Understand cookware materials and their pros and cons.
- Match cookware to your cooking style.
- Consider size and storage for small kitchens.
- Review four budget cookware picks.
- Quick FAQ and care tips.

## Cookware materials explained

Different materials suit different cooking styles:

- **Non-stick:** Easy to clean, uses less oil, but coating wears over time.
- **Stainless steel:** Durable, safe at high heat, but food may stick without proper technique.
- **Cast iron:** Excellent heat retention, lasts decades, but heavy and needs seasoning.
- **Aluminum:** Lightweight, heats quickly, but can react with acidic foods.

For beginners and small kitchens, non-stick cookware is usually the most practical choice.

## Non-stick coating quality

Not all non-stick coatings are equal:

- **PTFE (Teflon-type):** Most common, works well, safe at normal cooking temperatures.
- **Ceramic:** Marketed as healthier, but may wear faster than PTFE.
- **Stone or marble coating:** Durable variants of non-stick with good heat distribution.

Quality non-stick coating should last 1-3 years with proper care.

## Match cookware to cooking style

Consider what you cook most often:

- **Rice and soups:** Need a good pot with lid.
- **Stir-fry and sauteing:** Need a wok or frying pan with high sides.
- **Eggs and pancakes:** Need a flat pan with reliable non-stick.
- **Stews and braises:** Need a heavy pot that retains heat.

A basic set of one frying pan and one pot covers most everyday cooking.

## Size considerations for small kitchens

Small kitchens need space-efficient cookware:

- **Stackable sets:** Save cabinet space.
- **Multi-use pieces:** A deep frying pan can work as both pan and pot.
- **Removable handles:** Allow compact storage and oven use.
- **Moderate sizes:** 24-28cm pans suit 1-4 person households.

Avoid buying too many pieces that end up unused.

## Induction compatibility

If you use an induction cooker:

- **Check the base:** Induction-compatible cookware has magnetic bases.
- **Look for the symbol:** Many products mark induction compatibility.
- **Test with magnet:** If a magnet sticks to the base, it works on induction.

Non-induction cookware will not heat on induction stoves at all.

## Cookware care tips

Proper care extends cookware life:

- **Avoid high heat with non-stick:** Medium heat is usually enough and protects coating.
- **Use soft utensils:** Silicone, wood, or plastic prevent scratches.
- **Cool before washing:** Thermal shock can warp pans.
- **Avoid abrasive cleaners:** Soft sponges protect surfaces.
- **Store carefully:** Use pan protectors or stack carefully to prevent scratches.

## Quick FAQ

- **Question:** How long does non-stick coating last?

  **Answer:** With proper care, 1-3 years. Budget non-stick may need replacement sooner than premium brands.

- **Question:** Is non-stick coating safe?

  **Answer:** Modern non-stick is safe at normal cooking temperatures. Avoid overheating empty pans and replace when coating is damaged.

- **Question:** Should I buy a set or individual pieces?

  **Answer:** Sets offer better value if you need multiple pieces. Buy individual pieces if you only need one or two specific items.

Start with a basic non-stick pan and pot. Add specialized pieces only after you establish your cooking habits.
