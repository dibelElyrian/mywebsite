Running out of battery during a commute or a long day out is frustrating. A reliable power bank keeps your phone charged without hunting for outlets. This guide explains what to look for in a budget power bank and shares four picks from Shopee that fit common needs.

## Outline

- Understand capacity and charging speed basics.
- Match the power bank to your daily usage.
- Check size, weight, and port options.
- Review four budget picks for different needs.
- Quick FAQ and decision checklist.

## Capacity basics: mAh explained

Power bank capacity is measured in milliamp hours (mAh). Higher numbers mean more stored power, but real-world charging depends on efficiency losses.

- **5,000mAh** typically gives 1-1.5 full charges for most smartphones.
- **10,000mAh** gives 2-3 full charges, good for all-day use.
- **20,000mAh and above** suits heavy users or charging multiple devices.

For daily commutes and office use, 10,000mAh hits a practical balance between size and capacity.

## Charging speed: watts matter

Not all power banks charge at the same speed. Look for:

- **Standard 5W-10W** charging is slow but works with any device.
- **18W fast charging** cuts charging time significantly for compatible phones.
- **20W or higher** supports faster protocols like PD (Power Delivery).

If your phone supports fast charging, a power bank with matching output saves time. Check your phone specs before buying.

## Size and portability

A power bank only helps if you actually carry it. Consider:

- **Pocket-friendly size** for light carry in jeans or small bags.
- **Slim designs** fit better in crowded bags.
- **Weight** matters for long commutes, especially in messenger bags.

Mini or capsule-style power banks sacrifice capacity for portability. Choose based on how much you need versus how much you want to carry.

## Port options and cables

Check what ports the power bank offers:

- **USB-A** is the standard port for most cables.
- **USB-C** supports newer devices and often enables faster charging.
- **Built-in cables** eliminate the need to carry separate cords.

A power bank with both USB-A and USB-C gives flexibility for different devices.

- If organization matters, add a cable organizer bag to your setup.

## Quick FAQ

- **Question:** How many times can a 10,000mAh power bank charge my phone?

  **Answer:** It depends on your phone battery size, but most smartphones with 4,000-5,000mAh batteries get 1.5-2 full charges after accounting for efficiency losses.

- **Question:** Is it safe to use my phone while it charges from a power bank?

  **Answer:** Yes, but heavy use while charging generates more heat. Avoid direct sunlight or hot environments during charging.

- **Question:** How long does it take to recharge the power bank itself?

  **Answer:** A 10,000mAh power bank typically takes 3-5 hours with a standard charger, faster with PD or QC chargers.

Pick a power bank that matches your daily routine. A slim 10,000mAh model handles most needs without adding bulk to your bag.
