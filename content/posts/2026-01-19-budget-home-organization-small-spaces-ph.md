## Outline

- Identify your main clutter zones.
- Use vertical space and hidden storage.
- Choose multi-functional items.
- Review five budget picks for home organization.
- Quick FAQ and small space tips.

## Identify your clutter zones

Walk through your home and note where clutter accumulates:

- **Entryway:** Shoes, bags, keys, and mail.
- **Living area:** Remote controls, magazines, and random items.
- **Bedroom:** Clothes, accessories, and bedside clutter.
- **Kitchen:** Utensils, food containers, and cleaning supplies.

Each zone needs a specific solution. A catch-all basket helps the entryway; drawer dividers fix kitchen chaos.

## Use vertical space

In small homes, walls and vertical surfaces are underused storage. Consider:

- **Wall-mounted shelves** for books, decor, and small items.
- **Over-door organizers** for shoes, cleaning supplies, or accessories.
- **Stackable containers** that build upward instead of outward.
- **Tiered racks** for kitchen or bathroom counters.

Vertical storage keeps floor space clear and makes rooms feel larger.

## Multi-functional furniture and items

When space is tight, every item should earn its place:

- **Storage ottomans** serve as seating and hidden storage.
- **Bed frames with drawers** use under-bed space efficiently.
- **Foldable furniture** can be stored away when not needed.
- **Curtains with pockets** or hooks add functionality to window coverings.

Before buying any home item, ask if it can serve more than one purpose.

## Decluttering before organizing

Organizing clutter just creates organized clutter. Before adding storage:

- **Remove items you do not use or need.**
- **Donate or sell duplicates and outgrown items.**
- **Set a "one in, one out" rule for new purchases.**

Less stuff means less storage needed and easier maintenance.
