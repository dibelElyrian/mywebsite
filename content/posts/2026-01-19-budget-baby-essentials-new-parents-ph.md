## Outline

- Identify must-have vs nice-to-have items.
- Prioritize safety and hygiene basics.
- Choose practical feeding and bathing items.
- Review five budget picks for new parents.
- Quick FAQ and tips for first-time buyers.

## Must-haves vs nice-to-haves

Before buying, separate essentials from extras:

**Must-haves:**
- Feeding bottles and nipples
- Diapers and wipes
- Bath towels and washcloths
- Basic skincare (lotion, soap)
- Thermometer for health monitoring

**Nice-to-haves (can wait):**
- Fancy bottle warmers
- Automated rockers
- Matching nursery decor

Focus your initial budget on items you will use daily from day one.

## Safety and hygiene basics

For baby products, safety is non-negotiable:

- **BPA-free materials** for anything that touches food or mouth.
- **Soft, non-toxic fabrics** for items against baby skin.
- **Proper labeling** with age recommendations and certifications.

Budget products can meet safety standards. Check product descriptions for BPA-free claims and look for consistent positive reviews mentioning material quality.

## Feeding essentials

Feeding gear gets heavy daily use. Consider:

- **Bottle material:** Plastic is lighter and less breakable; glass is easier to clean and more durable long-term.
- **Nipple flow rate:** Match to baby age (slow flow for newborns).
- **Easy cleaning:** Wide-neck bottles are simpler to scrub.

Buy a starter set of 2-3 bottles first. You can add more once you know your baby's preferences.

## Bathing and skincare

Baby skin is sensitive. For budget bathing:

- **Gentle, fragrance-free soap** to avoid irritation.
- **Soft hooded towels** that dry baby quickly after baths.
- **Basic lotion** for dry patches, especially in air-conditioned rooms.

Avoid overbuying skincare. Most babies need only soap, lotion, and occasional diaper cream.
