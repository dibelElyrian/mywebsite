## Outline

- Identify essential travel items for your trip type.
- Prioritize durability and functionality.
- Consider airline baggage rules.
- Review five budget travel picks.
- Quick FAQ and packing tips.

## Essential travel items

Different trips need different gear, but basics include:

- **Luggage:** Suitcase or travel bag appropriate for trip length.
- **Passport holder:** Keeps documents organized and protected.
- **Toiletry bag:** Prevents leaks and keeps items accessible.
- **Packing cubes:** Organize clothes and maximize luggage space.
- **Neck pillow:** For long flights or bus rides.

Start with items you will use on every trip before buying specialized gear.

## Durability matters for luggage

Luggage takes a beating during travel. Look for:

- **Sturdy wheels:** Spinner wheels roll smoothly; double wheels last longer.
- **Strong zippers:** YKK or heavy-duty zippers resist jamming.
- **Hard shell vs soft:** Hard shells protect fragile items; soft shells expand for extra capacity.
- **Water resistance:** Protects contents during rain or spills.

A moderately priced durable bag beats a cheap bag that breaks after one trip.

## Airline baggage considerations

Know the rules before buying:

- **Carry-on size limits:** Most airlines allow 56cm x 36cm x 23cm or smaller.
- **Weight limits:** Typically 7kg for carry-on, 20-30kg for checked bags.
- **Budget airlines:** May charge for checked bags, making carry-on more valuable.

Choose luggage size based on your most common trip type.

## Organization saves time

Organized packing helps you:

- Find items quickly without unpacking everything.
- Maximize luggage space with compression.
- Keep dirty and clean clothes separate.
- Speed up security checks with accessible toiletries.

Packing cubes and organizers pay for themselves in convenience.
