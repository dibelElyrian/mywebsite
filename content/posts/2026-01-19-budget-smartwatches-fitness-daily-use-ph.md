## Outline

- Understand key smartwatch features.
- Match features to your actual needs.
- Consider battery life and charging.
- Review five budget picks for different uses.
- Quick FAQ and buying tips.

## Key smartwatch features

Modern budget smartwatches include many features:

- **Heart rate monitoring:** Tracks pulse during exercise and rest.
- **Step counting:** Measures daily activity levels.
- **Sleep tracking:** Monitors sleep duration and quality.
- **Notifications:** Shows calls, texts, and app alerts.
- **Water resistance:** Allows wearing during workouts or rain.
- **GPS:** Tracks outdoor routes for running or cycling.

Not every feature is useful for everyone. Focus on what you will actually use.

## Match features to your needs

Different users need different priorities:

- **Fitness enthusiasts:** Prioritize heart rate accuracy, workout modes, and GPS.
- **Casual users:** Focus on notifications, battery life, and design.
- **Health-conscious users:** Look for sleep tracking and heart rate monitoring.
- **Swimmers:** Require water resistance rating of at least 5ATM.

A feature-packed watch with features you do not use wastes money compared to a simpler watch that fits your routine.

## Battery life matters

Smartwatch batteries vary widely:

- **Basic fitness bands:** 7-14 days typical.
- **Full smartwatches:** 2-7 days typical.
- **Always-on display watches:** May need daily charging.
- **GPS-heavy use:** Drains battery faster.

If frequent charging is inconvenient, prioritize longer battery life over extra features.

## Display considerations

Budget smartwatches use different display types:

- **LCD:** Affordable, visible in sunlight, but less vibrant.
- **AMOLED:** Better colors and contrast, but may drain battery faster.
- **Always-on display:** Convenient but reduces battery life.
- **Touchscreen vs buttons:** Touchscreens are more versatile; buttons work with wet fingers.

For outdoor use, check sunlight visibility reviews.
