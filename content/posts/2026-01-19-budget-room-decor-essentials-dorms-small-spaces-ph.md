## Essential room decor pieces

Every small space benefits from these basics:

- **Carpet or rug:** Adds warmth and defines zones in open layouts.
- **Curtains:** Control light and add color or texture.
- **Blinds:** A cleaner, more modern alternative to curtains.
- **Accent pieces:** Small decorative items that add personality.
- **Functional decor:** Items that serve a purpose while looking good.

Start with window treatments and a carpet as your foundation.

## Space and lighting considerations

For small rooms, prioritize:

- **Light colors:** Whites, pastels, and neutrals make rooms feel larger.
- **Vertical patterns:** Draw the eye upward and add height.
- **Sheer fabrics:** Allow natural light while providing privacy.
- **Multi-function pieces:** Decor that doubles as storage or organization.
- **Minimal clutter:** Fewer items with more impact looks better.

Measure your windows and floor space before buying.

## Matching decor to your style

Consider what vibe you want:

- **Cozy and warm:** Colorful carpets, warm-toned curtains.
- **Clean and minimal:** Neutral tones, simple blinds.
- **Playful and bright:** Bold patterns, fun accent pieces.
- **Practical and functional:** Easy-clean materials, durable fabrics.

Your decor should reflect your personality while staying within budget.

## Window treatments in Philippine homes

Windows are key to small space decor:

- **Curtains:** Soften the room and block harsh sunlight.
- **Blinds:** Adjustable light control, modern look, easy cleaning.
- **Sheer options:** Privacy without blocking all light.
- **Blackout materials:** Essential for bedrooms if you work night shifts.

In the Philippines, consider humidity and dust when choosing materials. Easy-clean fabrics work best.
