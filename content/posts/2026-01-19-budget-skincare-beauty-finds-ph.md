Good skincare and makeup do not have to cost a fortune. Many budget products deliver solid results for everyday use. This guide covers what to look for in affordable beauty items and shares five picks from Shopee that match common needs.

## Outline

- Understand your skin type and needs.
- Choose products with proven ingredients.
- Start with basics before adding extras.
- Review five budget beauty picks.
- Quick FAQ and skincare tips.

## Know your skin type first

Before buying any skincare product, understand your skin type:

- **Oily skin** produces excess sebum, especially in the T-zone. Look for lightweight, non-comedogenic products.
- **Dry skin** feels tight and may have flaky patches. Prioritize hydrating ingredients.
- **Combination skin** is oily in some areas and dry in others. You may need different products for different zones.
- **Sensitive skin** reacts easily to products. Choose fragrance-free and gentle formulas.

Matching products to your skin type prevents wasted money on items that do not work for you.

## Look for proven ingredients

Not all budget products are created equal. Ingredients matter more than brand names:

- **Niacinamide** helps with oil control and brightening.
- **Vitamin C** supports skin brightness and antioxidant protection.
- **Hyaluronic acid** provides hydration.
- **SPF** protects against sun damage, essential in the Philippine climate.

Read ingredient lists rather than relying on marketing claims.

## Start with basics

A simple routine works better than a complex one you cannot maintain:

1. **Cleanser** to remove dirt and oil.
2. **Moisturizer** to hydrate and protect.
3. **Sunscreen** for daily UV protection.

Add serums, toners, and treatments only after establishing consistent basic habits.

## Makeup basics on a budget

For everyday makeup, focus on:

- **Lip products** that suit your skin tone and last through the day.
- **Light coverage** products rather than heavy foundation.
- **Multi-use items** like lip and cheek tints that reduce the number of products needed.

Quality lip products and a good brow pencil can elevate a minimal look without a full makeup kit.

  **Answer:** Yes, as long as they come from legitimate sellers and are not expired. Check for proper packaging and batch codes.

- **Question:** How long before I see results from skincare?

  **Answer:** Most skincare products need 4-8 weeks of consistent use before visible results. Be patient and avoid switching products too quickly.

- **Question:** Do I need expensive products for good skin?

  **Answer:** No. Ingredient quality matters more than price. Many affordable products contain the same active ingredients as premium brands.
