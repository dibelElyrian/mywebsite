## Outline

- Pick a light that fits your room size
- Understand battery capacity and runtime
- Charge and store safely for longer life
- Compare four budget emergency lights

## Choose the right size and brightness

Emergency lights are usually labeled by wattage or by the number of LEDs. For a small room, a basic 6W to 9W unit is often enough. For a larger living room, a bigger unit may be better.

Practical tips:

- A single light can cover a small bedroom or kitchen
- For larger rooms, place the light higher or use two smaller units
- Choose a unit that can stand or hang if you want flexible placement

## Battery capacity and realistic runtime

Listings may claim long runtime, but actual use depends on brightness level.

- High brightness drains battery faster
- Medium mode is usually enough for reading or cooking
- Low mode can stretch runtime for long outages

If a light has multiple brightness modes, it is easier to manage during long brownouts.

## Charging habits for longer life

Rechargeable lights last longer with consistent charging habits.

- Charge fully after each brownout
- Avoid leaving the light plugged in all the time if the battery gets hot
- Top up once a month if you have not used it

Check if the model uses a standard plug or USB so you can charge it easily.

## Placement and safety

Keep emergency lights in places that are easy to reach.

- One near the bedroom for quick access at night
- One near the kitchen if you cook during brownouts
- Keep cables tidy and away from walkways

Do not place lights near water sources or gas stoves when charging.

## Plan runtime for long outages

If outages in your area last several hours, plan how to stretch runtime:

- Use medium brightness for cooking and tasks
- Switch to low mode for background lighting
- Turn off lights in rooms you are not using

This simple routine can add an extra hour or two depending on the unit.

- Using very long extension cords across walkways

Choose one reliable emergency light first, then add a second unit if your home needs more coverage. A small, dependable light is better than a large unit you forget to charge.

*Details may change. Always confirm wattage, runtime, and charging method in the listing.*

## Quick FAQ

**How often should I test the light?**

Once a month is enough. A quick 2 to 3 minute test helps confirm the battery still holds charge.

**Is a USB lantern enough for a whole room?**

It can work for small rooms, but a larger wall unit is better for full room coverage.

**Can I keep it plugged in all the time?**

Some models allow it, but if the battery feels warm, unplug and charge only when needed.
